## Microservices

NOTE - Monoliths and two-tier architecctures are still vaible and can be the correct dpeloyment structure in certain use cases. For example for a small projecct with a low number of users, and the user base is not expected to increase. A monolith architecture is most effective.

#### Benefits of Microservices
- Agility
- Flexible Scaling
- Easy Deployment
- Technological Freedom
- Reusable Code
- Resilience

Microservices becomes more and more viable the large the project/app is and the larger the user base is.

#### Examples of users:
- Twitter
- Spotify
- Ebay
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Uber
- PayPal
- Many, many more

## Docker

One of the hottest skills in tech currently - Used for CONTAINERISATION.

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Virtualisaation takes too much processing power! Docker doesn't reservce resources, instead it only uses them when it needs to. Makes your machine and processing faster.

# Containerisation
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. This means we don't have to use virtulaisation, which takes up a set amount of resources even if it is not running. Instead, software running in a container only uses the resources it needs, when it needs them.

### Why use Docker?
- Improved and seamless container portability
- Even lighter weight and more granular updates
- Automated container creation
- Container versioning
- Container reuse
- Shared container libraries

### Initial setup

- Sign up for docker at https://hub.docker.com/ (use personal email)
- Download for windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Open .exe to run installer (it will take a few minutes)
- Restart machine if prompted to
- On restart Docker desktop app should automatically run, if not open it as admin
- You may need to install WS2 separately: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package
- If you needed to install WS2 separtaly, kill the old Docker process in Task Manager. Then run it again.
- run `docker --version` in terminal/gitbash to check version (`docker` for cheat-sheet)
